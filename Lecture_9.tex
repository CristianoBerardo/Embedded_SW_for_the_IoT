% \chapter{Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)}

% Embedded systems often need to measure values of physical parameters.

% These parameters are usually continuous (analog) and not in a digital
% form which computers (which operate on discrete data values) can
% process. Sensor examples:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Temperature
%     \item Light (or infrared or ultraviolet) intensity
%     \item Pressure
%     \item Blood pressure
%     \item Acceleration
% \end{itemize}

% Number of bits determines overall accuracy. There are always limitations and inaccuracies present in the conversion
% from Analog to Digital.
